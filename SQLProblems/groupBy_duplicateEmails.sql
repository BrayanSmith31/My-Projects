Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Nota. Cuando utilizamos una funciÃ³n agregada con group by utilizamos having en lugar de WHERE
cuando queremos filtrar por ciertas condiciones

SELECT email as Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(id))>1
