What is Searching Algorithm?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Searching Algorithms are design to check for an element or retrieve an elementro from
any data structure where it is stored.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two categories of Searching Algorithms:
---------------------------------------------------------
1- Sequential search: In this category we find "Linear Search", in this, we traverse the array
or list sequentially and every element is checked
2- Interval search: These algorithms are specifically design for sorted data structures. Here
we find the binary search
